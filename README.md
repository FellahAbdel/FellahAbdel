I'm DIALLO from Guinea. Ever since I was a child, I harbored a deep passion and curiosity for mobile phones, constantly exploring their settings and functionalities. As I matured from basic cellphones to smartphones and computers, I sensed a calling to delve further into the captivating, enjoyable, and challenging realm of technology. Following my high school diploma, I ventured to Morocco to study Mathematics, Physics, and a touch of Computer Science. Subsequently, I relocated to France to immerse myself in the world of Computer Science, relishing the opportunity to delve into languages such as C, Java, JavaScript, Python, and more. I find great satisfaction in constructing compelling and demanding projects.

Skills: C / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Java / GIT /
